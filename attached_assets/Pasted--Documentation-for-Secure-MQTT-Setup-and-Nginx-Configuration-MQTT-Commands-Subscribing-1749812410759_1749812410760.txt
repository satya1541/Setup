# Documentation for Secure MQTT Setup and Nginx Configuration

## MQTT Commands

### Subscribing to a Topic
To subscribe to a topic using `mosquitto_sub` with TLS encryption, use the following command:

```bash

mosquitto_sub -h mqtt.thynxai.tech -p 8883 -t "test/topic" --cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.pem --cert /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.pem --key /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.key -u satya -P satya123

```

#### Explanation:
- `-h mqtt.thynxai.tech`: Specifies the MQTT broker's hostname.
- `-p 8883`: Connects to the MQTT broker over TLS on port 8883.
- `-t "test/topic"`: Subscribes to the topic `test/topic`.
- `--cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.pem`: Specifies the CA certificate for verifying the broker.
- `--cert /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.pem`: Specifies the client certificate.
- `--key /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.key`: Specifies the client private key.
- `-u satya`: MQTT username.
- `-P satya123`: MQTT password.

### Publishing to a Topic
To publish a message to a topic using `mosquitto_pub` with TLS encryption, use the following command:

```bash

mosquitto_pub -h mqtt.thynxai.tech -p 8883 -t "test/topic" -m "Hello, MQTT!" --cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.pem --cert /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.pem --key /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.key -u satya -P satya123

```

#### Explanation:
- `-h mqtt.thynxai.tech`: Specifies the MQTT broker's hostname.
- `-p 8883`: Connects to the MQTT broker over TLS on port 8883.
- `-t "test/topic"`: Publishes to the topic `test/topic`.
- `-m "Hello, MQTT!"`: Message payload.
- `--cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.pem`: Specifies the CA certificate for verifying the broker.
- `--cert /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.pem`: Specifies the client certificate.
- `--key /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.key`: Specifies the client private key.
- `-u satya`: MQTT username.
- `-P satya123`: MQTT password.

## Nginx Configuration

Below is the Nginx configuration for serving the MQTT broker over HTTPS with WebSocket support.

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name mqtt.thynxai.tech;

    ssl_certificate /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.key;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8883;
        proxy_ssl_verify off;  # Optional: Disable SSL verification for backend
        proxy_ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
        proxy_ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    }

    # WebSocket Support (if needed for MQTT over WebSocket)
    location /mqtt {
        proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8883;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- `listen 443 ssl;`: Enables SSL on port 443.
- `server_name mqtt.thynxai.tech;`: Specifies the domain name.
- `ssl_certificate`, `ssl_certificate_key`, `ssl_trusted_certificate`: Paths to the SSL certificate, key, and CA certificate.
- `proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8883;`: Proxies requests to the local MQTT broker on port 8883.
- WebSocket support configured under `/mqtt` location block.

## MQTT Configuration

The following configuration is used for the MQTT broker (Mosquitto):

```bash
# Enable persistence
persistence true
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/

# Password file
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd

# Listener for secure MQTT (TLS) on port 8883
listener 8883
protocol mqtt

# TLS configuration
cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.pem
certfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.pem
keyfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/mqtt.key

# Allow only encrypted connections
require_certificate true

# Logging
log_type all
log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log

# Include additional configurations
include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
```

#### Key Points:
- `persistence true`: Enables message persistence.
- `password_file`: Path to the password file for client authentication.
- `listener 8883`: Configures the broker to listen on port 8883 with TLS.
- `require_certificate true`: Requires client certificates for authentication.
- `log_type all`: Logs all types of events.
- `log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log`: Logs to a specified file.

## Cloudflare Web Setting

Ensure the proxy setting (orange cloud) is turned off for `mqtt.thynxai.tech` in Cloudflare to avoid interference with the MQTT protocol.
